    <h1>Ukulele Lessons</h1>
    <div><p>Way back when I played guitar in a rock band transitioning later to keyboard. But I never forgot most of my chords.  
        These days Iâ€™ve found something less demanding, four instead of six strings, and almost as effective.  
        I play both tenor and baritone ukulele, each tuned to the top four strings of a guitar for easier learning and playing along with others.  
        I can teach this instrument to those also willing to sing as they play chords in various rhythmic styles.
