    <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
    <div>
        <p>As a teacher of music I have a sacred duty: do no harm to the musical psyche and soul of my students. </p>

        <p>My students present themselves at each lesson, through what they know of their talent at that time, in a state of vulnerability. 
            This is no time for judgmental or harsh behavior on my part.  Rather my duty is to make them feel glad that they came to their lesson, 
            listen for and praise incremental minor improvements, share my expectation that effective practice has occurred between lessons, 
            and to nurture each student in the skills necessary to become competent musicians.
            <br /><br />
            By virtue of the private time I am afforded with each student, I further consider my role as one of the adults who influences 
            the qualities of humanity in my pupils by enabling them to develop their pianistic skills.  I care about my students as much as I care about their musical progress.
            <br /><br />
            I must earn my students’ abiding respect by being an example of excellence, both musically and personally.   
            I practice what I preach through ongoing study and improvement in musicianship as well as musical pedagogy. 
            <br /><br />
            Of the many benefits from learning to make music, there is one that is often overlooked.  Making music can promote self-integration, 
            that feeling we get when key aspects of ourselves feel in harmony with each other. It’s when we’re “in the zone.”  The aspects I refer 
            to are our emotions and our thoughts. Music making constantly integrates feeling with thought. Building technical skills at the piano demands concentration.  
            Interpreting music in such a way that it touches the listener involves our emotions. This continuous coordination of reason and emotion, 
            I would go so far as to say, epitomizes the order and harmony we seek in ourselves and in our relationships with others.
            <br /><br />
            Finally, it is my belief that if we’re lucky enough to live a long and productive life, those of us who have tended regularly to 
            the “artist within”, who have learned to play the piano, or any musical instrument, will look back with a great sense of satisfaction 
            that we brought joy into our life and into the lives of others through the music we made.
