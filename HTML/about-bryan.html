        <p>I’m Bryan Stuart. I’ve been a teacher of piano, keyboard and other musical skills in the Inland Northwest full time for the past 10 years (part-time before that in other places). 
            My goal for my students is to equip them with the skills they need to become musically literate, able in the future to learn and play well on their own without the aid of a teacher.  
            <br /><br />
            I’ve studied music all of my life, well at least since the second grade when my mother signed me up for lessons.  
            That was over 50 years ago but I stuck with it.  I even majored in music, first at what was then called North Texas State University (the place where jazz education started) 
            and then did a masters at Southern Methodist University (the only school to have had the NCAA death penalty). Yes, I’m a recovering Texan but I checked my accent at the border. 
            Of course I endured an 8:00-5:00 career for 30 years, made some decent money, moved around the country, but now I teach piano and keyboard full-time.
            <br /><br />
            My students range in age from 7 to 70+. Some come with a specific goal, others ready to explore the possibilities. 
            Some would like to join their school jazz band, others would like to play from the Great American Songbook (jazz standards, as well as pop, rock, and more).  
            Some want to compose their own music; others want to play the music of other composers.
            <br /><br />
            I’m successful when my students know that they’ve become musically literate. 
            That means, in part, that they know how to breathe life into music they compose or reproduce.  
            They know how to practice effectively. They feel the excitement that comes from ending a performance with a flair, of realizing what they’ve accomplished, 
            and enjoying the accolades of others.
            <br /><br />
            I’m also successful when my students’ parents (or adult students) feel that they’ve received their money’s worth.  
            It’s tough for many to know what they’re getting for the tuition they pay. I strive to ensure accountability for my teaching.
