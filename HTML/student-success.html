    <h1>Student Success Indicators (aka: About You)</h1>
    <div><p>Many of Bryan’s students, depending on their level of skill, 
            commitment and length of training, gain the ability to approach most any piece or style of music and learn to play it well.  
            With a goal of becoming musically literate, they go on to enjoy enriched lives.

        <p>As a piano teacher I provide individualized instruction because each student brings their unique personality into the picture 
            along with a degree of talent and motivation to the adventure of learning to play.  
            It has been my experience that those who are successful share most of the following success factors:   
            <br /><br />
            <ol>
                <li>They are inwardly motivated.</li>
                <li>They take direction well.</li>
                <li>They carve out time in their schedules for effective practice</li>
                <li>They come regularly to lessons as prepared as they can
                        be.  If practice time hasn’t been available prior to a lesson,
                        the student comes anyway for related musical training.</li>
                <li>They practice at home on a good piano or keyboard.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition I have found that the most successful piano students are those with a good, if not solid, sense of rhythm.  
                Rhythm, the organization of sound in time, serves as the skeleton on which the body of the music is sculpted.  
                Some come to piano lessons already possessing a strong sense of rhythm.  Others have to work extra hard at it.  
                Then there are those who refuse to grasp this concept.  You’ve met them.  They say, “I used to take piano lessons but I quit.”</p>
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
                Not everyone wants the same end result from piano lessons.  But the successful ones want something from their efforts 
                and they want it strongly enough not to let distractions interfere too much.
