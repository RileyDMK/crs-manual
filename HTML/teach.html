    <h1>How I Teach</h1>
    <div><p>Students receive personalized instruction intended to create
            in them a love of making the music they enjoy along with the skills to do it well.

        <p>All students under my direction are taught basic technique: posture, hand position, etc. Students are grouped into one of two tracks.  
            Those in the Recreational Piano track are there to have fun without pressure to work too hard at it.  
            Some happily stay in that track while others start, or move into, the Artist Preparatory Track.  
            Here I teach advanced skills and repertoire and all that goes with gaining musical literacy.  
            <br /><br />
            My intention is to give all my students the lifelong confidence to approach a piece of music with the tools to decipher the rhythms and nuances that make for musical playing.  
            This also applies to those students with the courage to compose their own music.
            <br /><br />
            Since music is made to be heard I encourage my students to seek out performance opportunities, audition if necessary, and make them all learning experiences.
            <br /><br />
            Lessons in my studios, both in Spokane and at Country Road Studio are taught primarily on a Yamaha Clavinova.  
            These instruments replicate well the sound and touch of an acoustic grand or upright piano while offering added advantages such as making recordings of lesson accomplishments for future reference.  
            For some students interested in playing keyboard in a performing small band I offer training on a Nord Stage 2 and a Roland Jupiter.
