            Think of “Whole Foods” selling mostly organic food which, if you believe it, is more complete nutrition for the body.  Whole Music! is more complete musical nutrition for the soul.

        <p>As a piano teacher my job is to equip each student with the tools to make the most out of their emerging talent. Enabling students to acquire those tools, 
            and the habits of practicing that promote musical success, is what I call a WHOLE MUSIC! approach.
            <br /><br />
            WHOLE MUSIC! is about exploring every facet of the musical experience for each student. It’s about motivating and inspiring, by word, by example, 
            and with high expectations to ensure that a solid foundation of musical literacy is in place, one that will equip the student to make the most of his or her talent for years to come. It’s about encouragement and building on the little successes that make up the learning process.
            <br /><br />
            WHOLE MUSIC! is the application of the finest sequential teaching materials available, supplemented by works of the great composers, and personalized 
            to students of all ages and levels, whether new to piano or returning after an absence of playing. It takes courage to come to a piano lesson, especially that first one.  
            Playing for a teacher is an act of vulnerability and as such it is my first responsibility to do nothing that will harm the musical self-image of my students.
            <br /><br />
            The WHOLE MUSIC! approach accelerates musical literacy skills that if not learned early on can truly handicap a student for years. Take for example the 
            dreaded task of sight reading.  Research has proven that without an ability to sight read music a pianist must re-decipher the musical notation with each 
            new piece of music, often resulting in countless hours of laborious repetition and frustration. The lack of the ability to read music, however simply, 
            is one reason so many quit piano lessons early and regret it later.
            <br /><br />
            In my WHOLE MUSIC! studio I leave no element of a solid piano education to chance, whether that be good technique or the ability to play with passion.  
            Each student’s lesson is tailored to that student’s emerging or ingrained learning style and aspirations. I draw on proven, modern learning materials, 
            in the classical, jazz, and popular idiom while utilizing the latest digital keyboard on which students learn to be creative, to read music in a variety of ways, 
            to improvise, and to compose. 
            <br /><br />
            The WHOLE MUSIC! approach is:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Customized for each student, based on abilities, goals, and commitment</li>
                <li> A multi-key, intervallic approach</li>
                <li>Attentive to the fundamental building blocks for each stage of accomplishment</li>
                <li>Mindful that music is a language, to be read, expressed, and enjoyed</li>
            </ul>
            WHOLE MUSIC! is not:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Neglectful of essential elements required of successful musicians</li>
                <li>A knuckle wrapping, drill sergeant approach</li>
                <li>A repetitive rote process where one size fits all</li>
                <li>A rigid and strict, syllabus driven course</li>
            </ul>
            If you’ve found yourself nodding in agreement or appreciation with some of what you’ve just read, chances are there’s a good match between you, your child, and me.
