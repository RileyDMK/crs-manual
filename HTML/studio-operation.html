            Your lesson time is yours. You agree, when you enroll, that you will pay for those time slots during the first week of the month. 
            You know, or will know, the rate charged for each lesson and you simply multiply it by the number of lessons in the month that you know you, 
            or your child, will attend. Thatʼs your easy tuition calculation. I will also provide you with my calculation of your tuition for the coming 
            month in my monthly email to you.  I will not charge you for an absence when you’ve given me notice in the prior month nor will you be charged 
            for holidays and for lessons cancelled when I call to cancel a lesson due to illness, travel complications, snow, etc.
