    <h1>Lesson Tracks</h1>
    <div><p>Students have the option of two tracks for learning: Recreational Piano, just for fun; and, Artist Preparatory, even more fun but more challenging as well

        <h2>Recreational Piano</h2>
        <p> 
            This track is for those who just want to have fun, those who may have taken piano years ago and want to try again or brush up their skills, 
            and those who don’t want any pressure to perform.  It’s for parents who are hoping their child will “take to” the piano and for adults 
            who have always wanted to learn to play a few songs on the piano but never got around to it - until now. 
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Artist Preparatory</h2>
        <p> 
            This track is for students who are serious about learning, practicing, and performing, who envision themselves advancing beyond the beginner stage. 
            It’s for those who want to learn to be musicians of depth, and who are willing to organize their time for effective practice and preparation for each lesson.
