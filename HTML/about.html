    <h1>What's It About?</h1>
    <div><p>What’s it about?  Simple.  It’s about music. It’s about making life more fun. 
        It’s about connecting with others, bringing joy to their lives.  It’s about having a joyful hobby, 
        or profession, to add richness to a life well lived.  If you agree with that, we should get together.</p>

    <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#a1-more" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Learn More</button>

        <p>More specifically it’s about choosing a teacher who resonates with you and can teach the style of music you want to be playing. 
            You want exciting lessons filled with doable challenges, the accomplishment of which you will learn to welcome. 
            You want to know that others have had success with the teacher you are considering, what that success looks like and what it took to accomplish it.  
            And you’ll need to become certain of the details of how a piano teacher organizes lessons, fees, and policies. 
            <br /><br />
            Finally, you want a teacher who can play well and show what good musicianship looks and sounds like.  
            You want someone who can impart the secret of turning pages full of black note heads into a moving experience.
            <br /><br />
            If you’re thinking that’s what it may be about for you, or for someone close to you, then we should get together soon for a free consultation.  
            It could be the start of something special!
