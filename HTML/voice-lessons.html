    <h1>Voice Lessons</h1>
    <div><p>Having been trained as a vocalist who used his skills in both solo and ensemble performance, I can offer voice training at a modest level.  
        Students learn the importance of proper breath control, vowel and consonant production, singing in tune, and how to sell their music, whether personally composed or not, to an audience.
