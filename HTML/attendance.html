    <h1>Attendance Policies</h1>
    <div><p>I have chosen to accept you, or your child, as my student because Iʼm confident in the musical potential I’ve seen and equally confident that business matters, 
        such as regular tuition payments, will be handled promptly. What can be confusing, however, is what to do when you can’t attend a lesson or have to change one.

        <h2>Attended</h2>
        <p> 
            You, or your child, attended the lesson - simple as that.  Along with notes from the lesson, including assignments for the week, I may include a receipt for lesson payment.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Rescheduled</h2>
        <p> 
            This simply means that when you called, texted or emailed me to cancel we quickly found a mutually agreeable time slot for a make-up lesson.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Cancelled</h2>
        <p> 
            This means you cancelled the lesson ahead of time for reason of illness, or some unforeseen situation, but we did not schedule a make-up lesson at that time.  
            A cancellation does not mean a credit or refund in your next month’s tuition bill, unless that cancellation was made during the previous month.  
            A cancellation assumes a make-up lesson if at all possible. So plan to reschedule when you cancel. 
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Missed (No Show)</h2>
        <p> 
            This is a tricky one. Sometimes the memory slips.  But the primary reason a piano student is a “no show” is because no practice between lessons has occurred 
            and guilt takes over.  If this happens to you, please just acknowledge the guilt and show up.  I’ll see that we make good use of our time together.  
            Two missed lessons in a row, with no notice to me, and weʼll have a chat regarding your ongoing feelings about piano lessons. Three no-shows in a row and I will 
            assume you just donʼt know how to tell me goodbye and will simply remove you as an active student and make your time slot available for someone on my waiting list.
