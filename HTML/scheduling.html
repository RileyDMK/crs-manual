                To make the most of any music lessons on any instrument, a good teacher and a receptive student, having fun while learning, 
                need enough time to work on technique, sight reading, musicality, and many of the other things that go into the making of a great musician. 
                What’s often lacking in piano lessons is what I’ll call supervised practice, whereby I observe and guide my students to know how to 
                practice effectively so as to make the most of limited practice time at home. Part of the 75 minutes is devoted to effective practice skills. 
                A third componet of each lesson involves a thorough explanation of new material that I assign and new learning that is to take place.
