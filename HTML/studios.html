        <p>My studio in North Idaho, Country Road Studio, is equipped with a Yamaha Clavinova which replicates an acoustic piano.  
            I use many of the extra features offered with this instrument to enhance the studentsâ€™ experiences during lessons.  
            For students intent on composing or perhaps playing in a rock band (which I did on occasion over many years) 
            I have two state-of-the-art electronic keyboards for teaching: a Nord Stage 2 and a Roland Jupiter 76.  
            <br /><br />
            My studio in Spokane, WA is within Music City, the number one place where people in the Inland Northwest go to buy acoustic and electronic keyboards. 
            I have taught at Music City for the past 10 years and will continue on a limited basis while transitioning to Country Road Studio located near my home. 
            My Spokane studio is equipped with the latest Yamaha Clavinova on offer these days.
