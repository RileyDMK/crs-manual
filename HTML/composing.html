    <h1>Composing</h1>
    <div><p>Itâ€™s all well and good to play only the music that someone else has written.  Or is it?  What about the music within each person?  
        What about getting that down and into a song that can be well received by others.  Composing is quite a challenge but one that quite a few are ready to tackle.  
        My role in this endeavor is to act as a coach offering tactful, yet hopefully helpful, advice as a piece of music is being created.
